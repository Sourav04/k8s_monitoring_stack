# Kubernetes Observability Stack

This repository contains YAML files for deploying a full observability stack on Kubernetes, consisting of **Prometheus** for metrics collection, **Grafana** for visualization, and **Loki** for log aggregation.

## Components

- **Prometheus**: A monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for reliability and scalability. It collects metrics from your Kubernetes cluster and stores them for querying and alerting.
- **Grafana**: A visualization tool that pulls data from Prometheus and Loki to provide powerful, interactive dashboards.
- **Loki**: A log aggregation system that collects logs from your Kubernetes pods and stores them for easy searching and viewing.
